● The first terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, …
    ○ So last term value is 7 and its index is 5 (zero based)
    ○ The next value is either:
■ LastValue - LastIndex - 1 if the following 2 conditions are satisfied:
    ● value > 0 and It did not appear before
    ● E.g. 7 (last value) - last index (5) - 1 = 7-5-1 = 1 (> 0 but already exists)
■ Otherwise LastValue + LastIndex + 1 = 7+5+1 = 13
● Read integer zero-based index ([1, 200]) and print the value of this index
    ○ E.g. (6 ⇒ 13), (9 ⇒ 21), (17 ⇒ 25)
● Don’t use nested loops
● The series is: 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 21, 11, 22, 10, 23, 9, 24, 8, 25, 43
